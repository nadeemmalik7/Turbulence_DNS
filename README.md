Discussions, ideas, self-help on turbulence modeling using open source software such as Incompact3d and nek5000

Background: I have often wanted to use open source codes, but found that the raw code by itself is not that helpful especially since most such codes do not come with detailed instructions or user guides. Although there are forums for discussion -- which are useful -- often all you want is a hands on helping hand, an example, a mentor to get you going.
